Some scripts I find helpful




>>> ETL scripts
add_partition_daily_for_hourly_table.sh could be replaced with this command, but it seems to take longer to run:
etl hive-add-interval-partitions table_name --interval 2018-01-01-00/2018-01-15-00 --cluster prod-adhoc




>>> Python functions



>>> SQL scripts
